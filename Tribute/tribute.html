Their hiatus saw the release of her first solo album,&nbsp;Dangerously in Love&nbsp;(2003), which featured the US&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Hot 100number-one singles &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot;.</p>

            <p>Beyonc&eacute;&#39;s success has led to her becoming a&nbsp;cultural&nbsp;icon and earning her the nickname &quot;Queen&nbsp;Bey&rdquo;.&nbsp;In The New Yorker, music critic Jody Rosen described Beyonc&eacute; as &quot;the most important and compelling popular musician of the twenty-first century...&nbsp;the result, the logical end point, of a century-plus of&nbsp;pop.&quot;Author&nbsp;James Clear, in his book Atomic Habits (2018), draws a parallel between the singer&#39;s success and the dramatic transformations in modern society: &quot;In the last one hundred years, we have seen the rise of the car, the airplane, the television, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone, and&nbsp;Beyonc&eacute;.&quot; The&nbsp;Observer&nbsp;named her Artist of the Decade (2000s) in 2009.
            </p>
            <p>She is often credited for the cultural shift towards female pop singers rapping and for creating the staccato style of &#39;rap-singing&#39; she used in songs like &quot;Bug a Boo&quot; and &quot;Say My Name&quot;.&nbsp;Uproxx&nbsp;stated that Beyonc&eacute; is the primary pioneer of the singsong style that dominates Hip-Hop currently,&nbsp;while Sheldon Pearce of&nbsp;Pitchfork&nbsp;noticed her contribution in changing the sound of pop music radio with her hip-hop assisted style.</p>
            <p> She was known for coining popular phrases such as &#39;put a ring on it,&#39; a euphemism for marriage proposal, &#39;I woke up like this,&#39; which started a trend of posting morning selfies with the hashtag #iwokeuplikethis, and &#39;boy, bye,&#39; which was used as part of the Democratic National Committee&#39;s campaign for the 2020 election. Similarly, she also came up with the phrase &quot;visual album&quot; following the release of her fifth studio album, which had a video for every song. This has been recreated by many other artists since, such as Frank Ocean and Melanie Martinez. The album also popularized surprise releases, with many artists releasing songs, videos or albums with no prior announcement, such as Nicki Minaj, Eminem, Frank Ocean, Jay-Z and Drake.

            <h1>Artistry</h1>
            <h3>Voice and Musical Style</h3>
            <span>Beyonc&eacute;&#39;s music is generally R&amp;B, pop and hip hop but she also incorporates soul and funk into her songs.&nbsp;4 demonstrated Beyonc&eacute;&#39;s exploration of 1990s-style R&amp;B, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases. While&nbsp;she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyonc&eacute; recorded several Spanish songs for&nbsp;Irreemplazable&nbsp;(re-recordings of songs from&nbsp;B&#39;Day&nbsp;for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of&nbsp;B&#39;Day. To record these, Beyonc&eacute; was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.
                <h3>Influences</h3>
                <span>The feminism and female empowerment themes on Beyonc&eacute;&#39;s second solo album&nbsp;B&#39;Day&nbsp;were inspired by her role in&nbsp;Dreamgirls&nbsp;and&nbsp;by singer Josephine Baker. Beyonc&eacute;&nbsp;paid homage to Baker by performing &quot;D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu&quot; at the 2006 Fashion Rocks concert wearing Baker&#39;s trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas. Beyonc&eacute;&#39;s&nbsp;third solo album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, was inspired by Jay-Z and especially by Etta James, whose &quot;boldness&quot; inspired Beyonc&eacute; to explore other musical genres and styles. Her&nbsp;fourth solo album, 4, was inspired by&nbsp;Fela&nbsp;Kuti, 1990s R&amp;B, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire,&nbsp;DeBarge, Lionel Richie, Teena Marie, The Jackson 5, New Edition, Adele, Florence and the Machine, and Prince.

            <span>Described as being &quot;sexy, seductive and provocative&quot; when performing on stage, Beyonc&eacute; has said that she originally created the alter ego &quot;Sasha Fierce&quot; to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is. She described Sasha as being &quot;too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy&quot;, stating, &quot;I&#39;m not like her in real life at&nbsp;all.&quot;Sasha&nbsp;was conceived during the making of &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;, and Beyonc&eacute; introduced her with the release of her 2008 album, I Am... Sasha Fierce. In February 2010, she announced in an interview with Allure magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need Sasha Fierce.&nbsp;However, Beyonc&eacute; announced in May 2012 that she would bring her back for her Revel Presents: Beyonc&eacute; Live shows later that month.</span>
